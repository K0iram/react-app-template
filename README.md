This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a Create React App template with routing and scss preprocessor setup. I have added a basic navigation bar and a starter component to get up and running

To start:

1. Download the zip file to your computer and change the name to your application.
2. ```yarn install```
3. In ```public/index.html``` Change the ```<title>``` to your application name.
4. ``` yarn start```
